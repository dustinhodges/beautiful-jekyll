Fifteen years after a military coup deposed Chile's democratically elected socialist government, it's right-wing military dictator, Augusto Pinochet was up for reelection for another 8 year term. Here I use a dataset detailing the voting intentions of 2700 Chileans in 1988 in order to see how political polarization has evolved in 32 years and if some of the left-right demographic trends we see in our time might have correlates in 1988 Chile.: [blog post on Medium](https://medium.com/@hodges.dustin/fifty-thousand-police-stops-in-minneapolis-bccb446b0651).
